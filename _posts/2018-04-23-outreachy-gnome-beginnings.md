I realise I kind of disappeared for a few hours when I got the news and posted a few late tweets after so this is a better (and longer) timeline and explanation of things.

It was past noon (12:09/16:09Z) when I saw the email. I headed to Arlington with daisies shortly after (first celebrating with my mentor huzzah) to visit the Friedmans so they'd be the first to hear about it in-person (plus talk to them about other life changes since the last time I visited). It just felt like the right thing to do, sharing with them daisies and the first hours of raw happiness.

I've been accepted as an Outreachy intern for GNOME from May to August 2018!

GNOME is incredibly special and sentimental for me. I am so thankful and grateful for this opportunity from Outreachy and GNOME to work with my amazing mentor, Philip Chimento, on my GNOME project. I cannot describe or measure how much happiness and meaning this brings to my life.

This has been a wild 2-3 years of my life. Thank you for all of the people in my life, past and present, who've helped me get through it all to where I'm at today. Thank you to all of the friends who'd remind me near daily that I'm loved; that my life is not defined by failure (and never let it slide when I'd say I'm not good enough oops); that my life is valid and worth living, and wouldn't let me quit after countless nights where I thought it was the end. Thank you for helping me survive so I could have moments like these. I love you all so dearly.

I wish I could have shared this moment with Skylar, Eileen, Mindy, Natalie, too.

GNOME was the starting point for so many beginnings in my life from early high school leading up to who I am today. Once more this is the start to yet another new beginning with GNOME and Outreachy.

This is the last Outreachy and GNOME post that'll be on this specific blog. I will be setting up a second blog on my site with an RSS feed for the internship to separate my personal/random stuff from the next few months of blogging on what I'm doing with GNOME. The link will be here once it's ready! (Or check out the nav bar for it once it's there).
