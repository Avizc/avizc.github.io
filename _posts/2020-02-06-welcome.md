So, [I've created a new site](https://llzes.org/general/2020/01/07/welcome.html)!

Moving forward I will be putting most of my content there! I will also be migrating some of my content over to my new site. The link above has my rationale stated much more clearer. I've decided to branch out to a new site because I felt that the format of this site wasn't very approachable for pushing out new work, research, and more. I'll still keep this blog up but as a more personal blog.
