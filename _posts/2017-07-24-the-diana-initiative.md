Where do I even begin.

I cannot support The Diana Initiative. I wish now I had never heard of The Diana Initiative (formerly Tiaracon).

While I've had my fair share of folks victim blaming me in the past I definitely could not have imagined a night of being victim blamed, demeaned, an attempt of debunking my sexual assault last Monday (I'm sorry that 140 characters isn't enough for me to accurate depict what happened for five hours nor enough to define a word every time I use it), be accused of attacking the woman where the conversation began.

Maybe I should be glad now but Twitter didn't show me all of their tweets to me. It got filtered out from what I saw.

All done by someone who 'supports' sexual assault/rape victims.

I've already gone ahead and screenshot all the tweets in the event they get taken down.

Here's the thing: I had an issue with the presenter's choice of wording "avoiding rape". I think it's great she wants to empower people. Yes I think we need to teach people to not drug folks *and* to also be aware of unattended drinks. I was never saying, "- do NOTHING," I was saying, "Lets change how we talk about this."

It was always about the wording, not about the content.

It started out with a presenter for this week at The Diana Initiative tweeting about adding a slide on "avoiding rape". I followed back asking for clarification and asking on other situations. I really had hoped that'd be the end of it. For the full entire tweet chain you can go [here](https://twitter.com/securitybrew/status/889267462256168962).

We talked in the end through DMs. I think she's a lovely person and ultimately with different approaches on tackling the same issue left it at that.

Then I got the first message out of many that was kind of the exact reason I started this conversation.

On the accusation I self diagnosed myself with PTSD:

Here's my medical record. I didn't know I had PTSD until my doctors told me. I didn't ever want to be diagnosed with PTSD. I'm open about talking on it since in the past I completely went silent on people and let myself spiral mental health wise. Also this is a conversation happening in a space I thought was going to be safe. I thought talking about my experiences would help someone understand why the term "avoiding rape" wasn't okay with me.

Also I'm honestly not doing well with talking about this at all. Honestly I forgot the internet can be pretty shitty on this. So the accusations I'm getting now that are really coming in are just, yeah. This is really hard.

I really had no idea I'd spent my entire night defending myself.

And now I've got lovely tweets and more going further down this wreckage.

I had no idea that The Diana Initiative would take their side to the point of liking tweets supporting victim blaming. That has been the oddest case to me. How we say and word things matter and in this case even more so.

This has been a lesson to me that people like to 'support' those whom are sexually assaulted/raped until they talk about their experiences and it doesn't match their opinion or view on it. If that happens apparently the next step is to victim blame them and try to debunk their life. Which I'm not going to do a full run down of what happened to me over 5 hours in several 140 character tweets.

I wish people knew that coming out with these experiences does nothing beneficial to me and opens up hate towards me.

The Diana Initiative was something I really looked forward to. But it has become the least safe environment for me possible in a space that was originally set up to support and empower people. That is the greatest disappointment in this all. I'm also not really looking forward to potentially seeing some folks now.
