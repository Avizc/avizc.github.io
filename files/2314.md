The Onward March

I wake up
It’s 23:14
Faggot
Sweat drenched, quick breaths, panic
Vomit

I wasn’t always so fearful until I met you
Laws that can’t be changed
Echo in my ears
Ringing
and ringing
Voices, faces, people

I see you in there, your face, your voice, your tears
I can’t do anything
I’m powerless
Suicidal

I can’t help you as I watch you
Cut it all up to slivers
Take the pills
Sleep
Never wake up
Die

I can’t help but watch you be
Ashamed
Slut
Whore
Faggot
Dyke
Bitch

You always say the same things about yourself
I’m a failure, I can’t do anything
Why does this keep persisting in my mind
Why can’t I get rid of these thoughts
It was my fault it happened

It’s the same every night 
Faces
Memories
Screaming

You had me when I was at my most vulnerable point
Death, pills, calories
Small body
Big body
Terror

You went through it all alone, why did you do it all alone?
HIV/AIDS
Am I pregnant
Do I have an STD
If I speak up my life is ruined
I want to die
Be alone
Fucking slut

I couldn’t help you even after you got away from them
Failure, .83 GPA
Nobody, nothing
Faggot
Slut
Dyke

Everyone told you the same things, I just watched
Too young to understand
It’s not depression
You’re just being childish
Faggot

You could have told everyone what happened
Taken advantage of
Abused
Assaults

But you never spoke up

I saw you finally recovering, you took back your life
A’s for the first time
Friends at school
Joining clubs
Leadership teams

But then I saw you go back to where you came from
Mindy
Death, suicide
Funeral
Didn’t go
Too scared

It took over a year after you got away
Just spoke up this past December
Crying
Doctors office, unhappy doctor
Blood tests
Numb

I never saw you cry so much but I can understand why
Chlamydia - Negative
Gonorrhea - Negative
Hepatitis B - Negative
HIV - Nonreactive
AIDS - Nonreactive

Tears of happiness
You finally did it
There’s nothing wrong
It was just panic
Relief

You’re finally free now and I want to see you go
The onward march
Walk towards life
Don’t look back
March on

Go live
It's hard to see if I'll still be here
1 month, 6 months, 1 year

Just know that
I’ll be here for you
You're not alone anymore now
Little Bun
