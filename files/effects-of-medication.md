Effects of Medication

Escape the
stars of the
night as
you watch me
bleed and
swallow my tears
down my clenched
throat

Like the bird
swooning down
lowly by the
sea flying
dangerously too
close by to
sink

The moment just
remains as I 
still pace these sad
grey and white stone
paths that were
made

Doctors
just leads to
devouring pills by 
hours lingering for
years to take
tolls on my
health
awaiting for
me

Waiting for
myself to come
forthwith
the evidence of
my remainder
days before the
clock hits
00:00

Hello
world and
goodbye as
stars come to
my side
breathlessly
ending this
life
