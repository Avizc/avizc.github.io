# A Taste of Freedom

The children, the mother, the father–all living in a small white house with a red shingled roof. A place of despair: Only those who witnessed the secret of the house shared the pain inside Daily it continued with mother and child, screams and shouts, hits and bruises.

Mother controlled me with fear; I learned to fear and hate, but never to love. A woman with no mercy–merciless to her child, mercilessly spewing hatred through verbal and physical means.

My mother grasped only three concepts: Anger, shouting, and fists. My childhood consisted of running and crying and hiding. Mother resorted to running and screaming and searching.

Small hands pulling the covers over my head, curling into a human ball, and shrieking, “I’m sorry, I’ll never do it again!” She punched, jabbed, and digged her nails into my skin.

“You are not a part of this family, you are worthless, you should never have been born!”

I thrived outside the house–school, lessons, classes–where I experienced kindness from teachers and friends. Yet the clash of environments between the “outside” and “inside” in itself turned too conflicting to handle in silence.

First grade, Miss Schwan–we all called her Miss Swan–educated us about the word “abuse.” My insides twisted and turned, my body numbing as she listed off symptoms of abuse, hoping no one recognized the bruises that covered me.

If only mother never hit me, if only mother never screamed at me to kill myself, if only mother loved me like my friends mothers, then I might live without fear. It hit me then, my mother abuses me whereas other mothers love their children.

This realization lingered in my mind.

Hatred. 

Rebellion. 

I slowly launched a fight, child versus mother. Mother won every time no matter how hard I tried for years.

Sometime a few years later in the third grade, I led her through the house in circles. She ran after me for minutes yet I thought otherwise. “I’m going to kill you!” she screamed in Korean.

Unconsciously, I grabbed my shoes one by one each time ‘round the house. Then I bolted out the door from the small white house with the red shingled roof as she screamed after me down the driveway from the back kitchen door.
