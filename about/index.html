			<p>Communicating about myself has always been a struggle. I'd like to warn I'm transparent, blunt, and also very easy to see through. Whether that is a strength or leaves me to be seen as a very vulnerable person is up to you. <a href="https://avizc.github.io/2016/10/31/new-beginnings.html">This</a> is probably a better explanation on things.</p>
			<p>I fell in love with security as a child. In a lot of ways my entire life has been an experiment and test but in the production environment. This has been a challenge and one I have been tackling. Building my own education post high school has been a journey as I branch myself into anything that is cute to me. At the same time this has spread myself quite thin. In addition to that I am really, really, poor at networking, figuring out how to go about jobs, everything in that area.  If you have any advice on this Iâ€™d appreciate hearing it quite a bit.</p>
			<p>This is what I am interested in and self-studying (in alphabetical order):</p>
			<p>Assembly, Arch, binary reverse engineering, computer forensics, cryptography, digital fabrication, Kali, malware analysis, penetration testing, Python</p>
			<p>I am seeking for a paid internship or entry level position.</p>
			<p>Location does not matter as I am currently nomadic. In the last 12 months I have lived in Rhode Island, in the DC Area (DMV) NoVa, MoCo, P.G. County, and soon Baltimore. I have never been to the West Coast or anywhere further south. I will gladly travel to any city to do an internship. The reason I request paid internships is due to supporting myself. Any amount suffices so long as I can feed myself.</p>
			<p>My ultimate goal is to be on an active red team specialising in computer forensics and reverse engineering/analysis. I love understanding a system, finding things, and creating lovely things from it. This I have decided is the best way to help make the world better, benefit a wide range of folks, and make things more efficient.</p>
			<h1>miscellaneous</h1>
			<p>I love rabbits, cheesecake, and cute things. Crypto puzzles, locksport, postcards, are all things I love dearly. Human rights is something I have been passionate about for a vast majority of my life. I love public transit and airlines. I listen to a lot of music. I will pet your dog. I count up prime numbers while walking home on a chilly night with hot apple cider.</p>
			<p>I'm naturally cheerful. I eat a lot of dessert. I really am bad at stuff like this because I don't know how to talk about myself so I recommend meeting me instead over hot apple cider. People tell me I make a lot more sense that way rather than over the internet.</p>
			<p>Due to my nature of being drawn to anything cute I like a wide and random assortment of things. <a href="mailto:hello@avizajac.com">Message me</a> if you want to throw anything my way whether that's advice, (constructive) criticism, challenge me on things, cute puzzles, or really just about anything.</p>
