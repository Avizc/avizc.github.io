			<h2>Completed</h2>
			<p><b>Alice</b></p>
				<p><a href="https://avizc.github.io/2016/06/08/alice.html">Read here.</a> I wrote this for the Defcon 24 Short Story Contest. Not sure how to describe it but this is what was said about it:</p>
				<p><i>"Dystopian future, where the machines rein supreme? Heck yes!" - SweetGrrl, <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/forum/defcon/dc24-official-unofficial-parties-social-gatherings-events-contests/dc24-official-and-unofficial-contests/creative-writing-defcon-short-story-contest-ab/223488-creative-writing-contest-dcshortstory-winners">Defcon Forums</a></i></p>
			<p><b>Queercon 13 Contest: Soundcheck</b>
				<p><a href="https://avizc.github.io/2016/10/31/queercon-13-contest-soundcheck.html">Read here.</a> A write up of how I went about the first of two contests for Queercon 13, my thought process, what I learned from my mistakes after.</p>
			<h2>In-Progress</h2>
				<p><b>Electronic Badges</b></p>
				<p>Influenced by Defcon and Queercon badges, creating badges for trans hackers with a fellow trans hacker. We are aiming to make this low cost, have the badges communicate and connect during the conferences, and allow the sharing of contact info. I am the primary person working on the fabrication design of the badge.</p>
				<p>Updates</p>
				<p>Check out <a href="https://beyondbinaries.github.io/">Beyond Binaries</a>, a trans hacker group from Queercon/Defcon! We decided making a group was best to communicate easier and have an excuse to badge-ify more.</p>
				<p>Goals and Additional Info</p>
				<p>Researching: Purpose, shapes, functionality.</p>
				<p>Traces: To be done after shape and research of badge designs are done.</p>
				<p>Programming: Primarily will be done by the wonderful Emily!</p>
			<p><b>Macaron Canary</b></p>
				<p>A warrant canary project to simplify the topic of National Security Letters (NSL), create a set of varying canaries (e.g. text, image) that providers can use in their transparency reports, and also create an open feed on each provider so immediate changes can be discussed.</p>
				<p>Goals and Additional Info</p>
				<p>Research: Never ending. Feel like a encyclopedia now.</p>
				<p>Basic website: Working on it!</p>
				<p>Profiles for each provider: I'm aiming at tackling it kind of like a weird Keybase/Facebook profile mash up! I want folks to be able to "vote up" an alert someone makes if there has been a change in a transparency report, eventually triggering a change in the warrant canary status of that provider.</p>
				<p>Basic templates for warrant canaries (text, graphic): This is so new providers can simply add them and tweak them to their own hearts desire.</p>
			<p><b>Untitled</b></p>
				<p>An app with a "Marco" "Polo" system connecting those requesting help and those seeking to give it, creating a localized web of trust allowing those in the inner web to ask in a non-invasive manner if they are okay/need assistance. A current dilemma is if it accidentally connected an abuser to their victim as it is anonymous. Any suggestions for that I'd love to discuss it!</p>
				<p>Goals and Additional Info</p>
				<p>Research: I'm basing a lot of this on my experiences being on the streeets but am doing additional research. This one is a work in progress as I wish to ask those with more experience how I can help with domestic violence victims in this regard.</p>
				<p>App: Need to start. I am planning on doing this for the Google Play Store primarily because: A.) Android is the most accesssible OS when it comes to cost for the audience I am targeting B.) I am very comfortable with Java.</p>
