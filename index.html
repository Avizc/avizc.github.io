	<h1>Nice to meet you, I'm Avi.</h1>
	 <p>I like rabbits, cheesecake, and cute things.</p>
            <p>Nontraditional, I'm sporadic with what I know (and don't).
		    Get to <a href="/about">know me</a> a little bit. Maybe <a href="/blog">check out</a> what I'm working on,
               if that's a bit confusing <a href="/projects">a quick page</a> of things I'm doing, and lets chat!</p>
